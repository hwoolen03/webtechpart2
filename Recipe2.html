<h2> Labskaus</h2>
<h3> How to make </h3>



<p>
  <li>
 1 small onion, chopped
</li>
<li>
4 teaspoons unsalted butter, or margarine, divided
</li>

<li>
1 pound potatoes, about 4 medium, peeled and quartered
</li>
<li>
1/2 cup milk
</li>
<li>
1 cup beef broth
</li>
<li>
10 ounces corned beef, homemade or canned, chopped
</li>
<li>
1 (15-ounce) can pickled beets, in slices
</li>
<li>
1 tablespoon pickled beet juice
</li>
<li>
9 rollmops, pickled herring wrapped around a gherkin pickle
</li>
<li>
3 large eggs
</li>
<li>
Salt, to taste
</li>
<li>
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
</li>
</p>


<p>

<li>
Cook the potatoes in salted water until soft.
</li>
<li>
  Brown the onions in 2 teaspoons butter for 3 minutes and remove from heat.
</li>
<li>
  Brown the corned beef cubes in the same pan until warmed through.
</li>
<li>
  Chop 5 beet slices small, reserving the rest.
</li>
<li>
  Drain the potatoes and add the milk. Mash the potatoes with a potato masher (they will be chunky). Add enough broth to make the potatoes wet, but not runny. Fold in the browned onions, chopped corned beef, chopped beets, and the beet juice. Season with salt and pepper.
</li>
<li>
  Using a non-stick pan, melt 2 teaspoons butter and fry the 3 eggs. Salt and pepper to taste.
</li>
<li>
  Divide the labskaus onto 3 pre-warmed plates. Arrange 1 fried egg on top of each mound of labskaus, add the rollmops, the reserved pickled red beets, and spicy German pickles and serve immediately
</li>
